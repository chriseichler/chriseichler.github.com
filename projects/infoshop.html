        <h4>iOS App Concept and Design • Timeframe: 2 weeks • Role: Co-Designer</h4>
        <p class="textbox">There are about 100 million sites and apps that offer things to people for purchase. But there are very few that help a person know where their money goes when they make a purchase. What and who are they supporting? In an effort to increase consumer and citizen awareness of how buying power is used, I created the concept for Infoshop and create a full design of the application over the course of 2 weeks, working on a team of 3.</p></br></br>

        <h2>Partnering</h3>
        <p class="textbox">The idea I had to empower consumers through an app was a big one. I don't think that our small team can do it all alone. Which is why we looked for an organization to partner with. We researched a number of NGO's that work on consumer protection and information, education, and advocacy about economics, monoplization, and other related issues. The idea was to offer this application to an NGO as a project.

        <p class="textbox">
          We decided we'd love to work with Public Citizen, and organization founded in 1971 with a mission represent ordinary people in the halls of power. They've been a consistent voice of opposition again mega-corporations and monopoly. This project has nothing to do with Public Citizen at this point, as they have not agreed to work with us. But we used their name and logo in our test design.

        <h2>Talking to People</h2>
        <p>
          Without speaking to potential users of Infoshop, we really couldn't know whether there was interest enough to build it. We might be unique in our interest in the topic. So we set out to interview people, beginning with a screener/research survey that netted 86 responses.
        </p>
        <img class="centerimage" src="../images/infoshop_surveys.jpg" /></br></br>
        <p>
          The charts show that the responses in the survey showed overwhelming interest in better tracking what one supports with his or her money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picking from the screener survey respondents as well as others, we did in-depth interviews with 7 people. These interviews were the heart of our research. We believe in letting people tell us about their experiences and not leading them or judging. It's important to ask about things that have happened in the past or regularly happen in someone's life, because there's often a gap between what we say we believe and how we behave.

          On HashTravel's side what is wanted is a vibrant community of users that produces interesting content. But what do the users really want or need?
        </p>

        <p class="pullquotes">“I go grocery shopping at Stop & Shop and I feel guilty about it every time. They source food from giant factory farms."</p>

        <p class="pullquotes">"When I buy clothes and stuff I’m way more willing to spend more money to buy clothes that are not made by like 8 year olds in Indonesia"</p>

        <p class="pullquotes">"You have to know the parent company."</p>

        <p class="pullquotes">"I feel like community and neighborhood shops really contribute to the economy</br> in a different kind of way."</p>

        <h2>Narrowing the Focus</h2>
        <p class="textbox">We had gathered a lot of stories about peoples' habits and beliefs. We had to consolidate and discuss what they meant. There was a range feelings among the respondents: some people more apathetic, and some strongly interested in supporting companies whose values they believed in. But the trend was toward caring. This told us that even if this product was not for everyone, it could potentially be for many people, and perhaps even most.
        </p>
      </br>
         <p class="textbox">But in what way would they care, exactly? And what tools and features would best suit our potential customers' needs?
        </p>

        </br>
         <p class="textbox">We sketched and drew to help answer these questions.
